# [Activity Selection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/activity-selection-1587115620/1)
## Medium
Given two arrays start[] and finish[], where start[i] and finish[i] represent the start time and finish time of the i-th activity, find the maximum number of activities that a single person can perform.
A person can perform only one activity at a time, and no two selected activities can overlap. If an activity finishes at time x, the next selected activity must start at a time greater than x.
Examples:
Input: start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]Output: 4Explanation: One possible selection is activities {0, 1, 3, 4} with time intervals (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 7), and (8, 9). Each activity starts after the previous one finishes, so a total of 4 activities can be performed.
Input: start[] = [10, 12, 20], finish[] = [20, 25, 30]Output: 1Explanation: Activity 0 finishes at time 20, and activity 2 also starts at time 20. Since the next activity must start after the previous one finishes, they cannot both be selected. Hence, only one activity can be performed.
